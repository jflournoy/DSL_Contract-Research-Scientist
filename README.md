## CfP Summary

The Developer Success Lab is an innovative, cross-disciplinary research team that produces public-facing applied research on how developers and technology teams learn, work and thrive. We want to change how the world understands, values, and invests in developer teams. To achieve this, we tackle far-reaching, meaningful questions at the intersection of the social and behavioral sciences, and software research. 

We are currently seeking proposals to engage with a research scientist consultant on targeted projects on the team for a roughly three month period, fully remote, US-based, providing a range of research management and scientific design support for our existing projects. We expect an hourly commitment of approximately 20 hours a week, but are open to flexible arrangements. We are open to designing this engagement with the right individual. This consultant will work closely with scientists in the lab to define methodologies, lead scientific practice, and help to scale community-based practices in the lab such as leading qualitative interviews, community focus groups, and analyzing qualitative data. There is an opportunity to become a co-author on original scientific manuscripts and publishing, contingent on original design contributions to the projects that follow the Developer Success Labâ€™s authorship policies.

## Expected Experience

- PhD in a research intensive field that aligns with our topics. We expect psychology and behavioral social sciences to be most relevant, but are open to considering other PhD topic areas.
- Demonstrated experience ensuring that a portfolio of research projects are delivered which meet a high bar of scientific rigor, create cross-functional impact, and demonstrated commitment to and experience with maintaining participant trust and participant wellbeing. 
- Demonstrated experience in mentorship and technical leadership with research scientists. Ability to pair with expert practitioner roles to understand the business need for research and facilitate alignment between research projects and other research-informed assets such as materials, toolkits, community activities, and marketing materials.  
- Research management skillsets in qualitative research, scaling up the administration of original data collection, facilitating and maintaining new methods of data collection and participant management, familiarity with IRB submission  
- Measuring and tracking impact and reporting across a portfolio of lab projects and research initiatives, and strong communication skills.
